## Heyyy Everyone ! ⭐
Welcome in my tiny universe, my name is Liz and I'm a student starting in the world of programming.  
I'm currently doing a BTS SIO SLAM option in France and I intend to continue my studies in this field
which allows so much freedom!
I'm passionate about digital art, creating stories, and the art of sending messages through the simplest things

	Creating is the life I choose 😎

	·˚✎  Through Writing  
	·˚✎  Through Drawing  
	·˚✎  Through Projects  
	·˚✎ ﹏ and of course the coding  


## I'm here for :
- [x] Progress
- [x] Discover people and projects
- [x] Share my own projects and developments
- [x] Participate in the github community
- [ ] To make pancakes (One day maybe)
